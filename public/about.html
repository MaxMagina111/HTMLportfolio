<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Maxwell's Portfolio</h2>
<p>
  Hello there! I'm Maxwell Magina a passionate student
  based in Nairobi, Kenya. Studying Full stack web
  and mobile development. 
  Welcome to my digital universe corner, 
  where code meets creativity and innovation. 
</p>
<h2>My Story So Far</h2>
<p>
  Picture this; a student on a journey to master 
  the art and mysteries of web development 
  driven by curiosity, and an undying hunger to grow 
  and create seamless digital experiences. That's me!
  With my wit and a keyboard I'm crafting my saga
  one project at a time. 
</p>
<h2>Why Development?</h2>
<p>
  For me development is more than just lines of code, 
  it's about crafting solutions that inspire and empower 
  from aesthetics in front end to the functionability of the back end.
  The dance between design and technology excites me
  as it brings ideas to life.
</p>
<h2>My Toolbox</h2>
<p>
  I'm striving to build up work that leaves a lasting impression 
  armed with a toolkit filled with languages like [HTML, CSS & javascript]. 
  I am constantly pushing my skills to stay on top of my game. 
</p>
<h2>Projects in Progress</h2>
I am always elbows-deep in one project or another all are a testiment to my 
dedication and passion.

<h2>Outside the Workspace</h2> 
<p>
  When I'm not nose deep in the world of web development,
  you'll find me in either watching a movie, reading novles or travelling.
  These moments of exploration and inspiration outside work 
  contribute to my holistic approach to problem solving.
